"""
Pagination for comments threads.

Given the following comments structure the paginator will display comments
in several pages containing different number of comments, so that comment
threads (a thread of comments have all the same value for thread_id) are
fully displayed in one page. Even if the number of comments in the thread
exceed the `per_page` value.

Relevant settings:
 * COMMENTS_INK_ITEMS_PER_PAGE = 25
 * COMMENTS_INK_MAX_LAST_PAGE_ORPHANS = 10

Example 1:
  Comment IDs of level 0:  [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8]
  Their `nested_count`:    [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,  5,  4]
  Computed comments/page:  [    22,     22,             33]

  Thread 1 has 11 comments, still below per_page. We add Comment thread 2, now
  we have 22 comments, still below per_page. We add Comment thread 3 and now
  the result exceeds per_page, so we will only accept it if not only adding
  Comment thread 3 but all the rest represents a number of comments below
  per_page + orphans, which is not the case: 77 comments > per_page + orphans.
  So page 1 contains 22 comments, and we move to compute comments for page 2.
  Page 2 start with 11 comments of Thread 3, we add 11 comments of Thread 4,
  and when we try to add Thread 5 we have over per_page, so we will only accept
  it if adding all the rest will represent a number of comments below
  per_page + orphans, which is not the case: 55 > 35, so page 2 will contain
  22 comments of Thread 3 and Thread 4. Page 3 starts with 11 comments of
  Thread 5 + 11 comments of Thread 6. Adding the 6 comments of Thread 7 would
  exceed per_page, so we will only accept to change page 3 if adding all the
  rest would keep the number of comments below per_page + orphans. And that is
  the case now: 22 comments (thread 5 + thread 6) + 11 (thread 7 + thread 8) is
  33 comments, which is below 35, so the last page contains 33 comments.

Example 2:
  Comment IDs of level 0:  [ 1,  2, 3]
  Their `nested_count`:    [24, 24, 8]
  Computed comments/page:  [25,    34]

  Comment 1 has 24 nested comments, it doesn't exceed per_page (25), but
  adding all the rest of comment threads would exceed per_page + orphans, so
  the 1st page displays 25 comments (comment 1 + its 24 nested comments).
  Comment thread 2 is made of 25 comments. Adding all the rest (34) would not
  exceed per_page + orphans (35), so the 2nd (or last page) will have 34
  comments.

Example 3:
  Comment IDs of level 0:  [ 1,  2, 3]
  Their `nested_count`:    [24,  8, 8]
  Computed comments/page:  [25,    18]

  Comment 1 has 24 nested comments, it doesn't exceed per_page (25). Adding
  all the rest (18) would represent 43 comments which exceed per_page + orphans
  (35). So the 1st page displays the 25 comments of thread 1. For page 2,
  comment thread 2 has 9 comments, and adding the rest is still below
  per_page + orphans, so the 2nd page will contain 18 comments.
